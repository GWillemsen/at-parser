# at-parser
A small generic C library to parse AT+ commands.
The goal is that your application can easily be extended with accepting AT commands as a interface.
It is still a work in progress so things might change a bit, but I think the global interface is reasonably stable now.

I wrote/am writing this library for my own personal use.
Maybe it can be useful to you as well.
